# North TypeScript/Forth Machine implementation documentation

In most cases, documentation is written to help brainstorm solutions, and later and only half-heartedly edited after code implementation.

- [Conditional implementation](IF_ELSE_THEN.md) - Detailed, requires review and update.
- [Loops](LOOP.md) - Introduction to a few loop implementations.
- [Data Structures](DataStructuresByExample.md) - outdated and certainly wrong.
